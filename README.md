gets an XML of VAST format, and saving the add request per user and sdk version.

the url to check if it works should look like this: (this is not a secure env, since it runs localy)
http://localhost:5000/get-ad?user=[USER_NAME]&sdk=[SDK_VERSION]&country-code=[COUNTRY_CODE]&seesionId=[SESSION_ID]&platform=[PLATFORM]

where [SOMETHING] is the string / number you should enter to check

2. impression: 
saving impression and on success returning 200 

the url to check if it works should look like this: (this is not a secure env, since it runs localy)
http://localhost:5000/impression?user=[USER_NAME]&sdk=[SDK_VERSION]&country-code=[COUNTRY_CODE]&seesionId=[SESSION_ID]&platform=[PLATFORM]

where [SOMETHING] is the string / number you should enter to check

3. get-stat: 
getting a json per user/sdk of the user name/ sdk version (depending on the filterType) 
and the number of impressions, ad requests, and fill rate (impressions/requests) per user name/sdk version.
